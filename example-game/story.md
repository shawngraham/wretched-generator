# What Lies Beneath: An Archaeological Mystery

## Your Character

**Name:** Dr. Elisabeth Blackwood  
**Occupation:** The Most Junior Member of the Department 
**Location:** A remote cave system in the English countryside  
**Date:** June 15th, 1924

You are Dr. Elisabeth Blackwood, one of the few women working in the male-dominated field of archaeology. After years of being dismissed by the academic establishment, you've staked everything on this excavation.

A local farmer told you about a cave on his land—a cave with strange markings and rumors of ancient habitation. The Royal Archaeological Society laughed at your proposal. Your former mentor politely declined to help. Your family thinks you've lost your mind.

But you know. You've always known. This cave holds secrets that could revolutionize everything we understand about prehistoric Britain.

You've set up camp near the entrance. Your equipment is modest: trowels, brushes, notebooks, a camera, and determination. The cave waits, dark and silent, holding its mysteries close.

Your academic reputation is on the line. Your evidence is limited. Your mental state is fragile. But this is your chance—perhaps your only chance—to prove yourself.

## How to Play

### Setup

- Begin with **10 Evidence Fragments** (representing the archaeological evidence you collect)
- Your **Academic Credibility** starts at 100 (representing your reputation and mental state)
- You have a standard deck of 52 playing cards
- Keep a journal to record your discoveries

### The Core Loop

Each session of excavation follows this pattern:

1. **Roll 2d6** to determine your focus for this session
2. **Draw cards** equal to the dice total (2-12 cards)
3. **Respond to each card's prompt** in your journal
4. **Follow any special instructions** on the cards
5. **Continue** until the deck is empty or the game ends

### The Cards

The deck represents the unpredictable nature of archaeological work. Each card draws you deeper into the cave's mystery:

- **♠️ Spades - The Cave's Secrets:** Discoveries, mysteries, and revelations within the cave
- **♥️ Hearts - Academic Relations:** Your peers, rivals, supporters, and the establishment
- **♦️ Diamonds - Resources and Methodology:** Tools, techniques, and practical challenges
- **♣️ Clubs - Mental Strain:** Psychological pressure, exhaustion, and doubt

### Evidence Fragments

Your **Evidence Fragments** represent the quality and quantity of archaeological evidence you've collected. This is your currency of credibility.

- Start with **10 Evidence Fragments**
- Cards can add or remove Evidence
- If you reach **0 Evidence**, you've destroyed or lost all the proof of your discovery
- You can go negative (representing fabricated or questionable evidence)

### Academic Credibility (The Tower)

Your **Academic Credibility** represents both your reputation and your mental state. Like a Jenga tower, it starts stable but becomes increasingly precarious.

- Start with **100 Credibility**
- Some cards require you to **Pull Blocks** (reduce your Credibility)
- When you pull blocks, the game simulates removing pieces from a tower
- **The risk escalates:** Lower Credibility means higher chance of losing more points
- If Credibility reaches **0**, your reputation collapses and the game ends

The escalating risk mechanics:
- **Above 50:** Low risk (stable)
- **20-50:** Moderate risk (dangerous)
- **Below 20:** High risk (critical)

### Winning

You **win** if you complete the excavation successfully:

- Draw all 52 cards from the deck
- Maintain positive Evidence Fragments
- Keep your Academic Credibility above 0

Your triumph is complete: your work survives peer review and publication. You revolutionize archaeology! Dr. Elisabeth Blackwood's name will echo through history.

### Losing

You **lose** if either:

1. **Academic Credibility reaches 0:** Your reputation collapses. You might retreat in shame or become an unpaid assistant to a rival.

2. **Evidence Fragments reach 0:** You've destroyed all archaeological evidence. The cave has lost its mystery. You become a schoolmistress in a local village, your dreams of archaeology behind you.

## Game Mechanics Detail

### Turn Structure

1. **Begin your excavation session** by rolling 2d6
2. The total determines how many cards to draw this turn (2-12)
3. **Draw the indicated cards one at a time**
4. Read each card's prompt and follow its instructions
5. **Write your response** in your journal—this is where the story lives
6. Apply any mechanical effects (Evidence changes, block pulls)
7. When all cards for the turn are resolved, you can:
   - Roll again to continue excavating
   - Take a break to organize your notes
   - End the session

### Special Cards

#### Ace of Hearts: "Letter from the Society"

This card requires a special roll:
- Roll 1d6
- On a **6:** Your defense is persuasive. Gain 1 Evidence
- On **1-5:** Your defense falls flat. Lose 1 Evidence

This represents the Society's judgment of your work.

### Journaling

Your journal is the heart of the game. This is where you:

- **Describe discoveries** in vivid detail
- **Express your character's emotions** and thoughts
- **Record the academic politics** and personal struggles
- **Build the narrative** of your excavation
- **Document evidence** as a Victorian scholar would

There's no wrong way to journal, but consider:
- Writing in first person as Dr. Blackwood
- Dating your entries
- Using period-appropriate language and perspective
- Describing not just what you find, but how it feels
- Grappling with the isolation, pressure, and wonder

### Saving Your Work

The game automatically saves your progress to your browser. You can also:
- **Save to File** to download your journal as a text file
- **Load File** to restore a previous journal
- **Start New Game** to begin fresh (warning: this erases everything)

## Tips for Play

### For Your First Game

- Don't rush. Read each card carefully.
- Really imagine yourself in the cave—the darkness, the damp, the weight of earth above.
- Let your journal entries be messy and emotional. You're under pressure!
- Don't worry about "winning"—the story you create is the real victory.

### For Deeper Immersion

- Play with atmospheric music (cave sounds, Victorian-era music, or silence)
- Dim the lights
- Actually write by hand in a physical journal
- Research real Victorian archaeology to inspire your descriptions
- Set a timer and treat it like a real excavation session (2-3 hours)

### Managing Risk

- **Early game:** Be bold. You have plenty of Credibility to spare.
- **Mid game:** Start being cautious. Consider the risk before pulling blocks.
- **Late game:** Every block pull is terrifying. Choose wisely.

Remember: The game is designed to create tension. The escalating risk means the endgame should feel genuinely dangerous.

### Interpreting Cards

The cards provide prompts, but you decide how to interpret them:
- Maybe that "golden idol" is actually an elaborate hoax
- Perhaps "academic jealousy" motivates you rather than demoralizes you
- The "burial site" could rewrite everything we know about the period

Let the cards guide you, but the story is yours.

## Historical Context

### Archaeology in 1924

The 1920s were a transformative time for archaeology:
- Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922
- New scientific methods were emerging
- Women in archaeology faced immense barriers
- The field was dominated by wealthy amateurs and established academics

### Dr. Elisabeth Blackwood

You are pushing against an establishment that doesn't want you there. You're one of the first generation of professionally trained female archaeologists. You've had to work twice as hard for half the recognition.

This cave is your chance to prove yourself—but also to make a genuine contribution to human knowledge. The cave doesn't care about your gender. The ancient people who lived there left their mark for someone to find. That someone is you.

### The Setting

The cave is fictional, but inspired by real archaeological sites:
- Creswell Crags in Derbyshire
- Chauvet Cave in France
- Various British cave systems with evidence of human habitation

The Victorian countryside, the academic politics, the isolation—all rooted in historical reality.

## About This Game

**The Cave** is a solo journaling RPG using the "Wretched & Alone" game system created by Chris Bissette. It explores themes of:

- **Ambition and obsession**
- **Gender barriers in academia**
- **The weight of history**
- **Isolation and discovery**
- **The price of knowledge**

The game asks: What would you sacrifice for recognition? For truth? For the chance to touch the past?
